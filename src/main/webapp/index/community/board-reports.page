Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.
 
Community
=========
Guillaume Nodet and Jean-Baptiste Onofr√© were presents at
the ApacheCon.
Two talks were related to Karaf.
 
Several projects are interested to use Karaf.
 
The Karaf community starts to help others projects to be OSGi
compliant (work started on Apache Archiva and Apache Whirr).
 
Development
============
A new release has been voted:
* Apache Karaf 2.2.4
 
We are now focusing on Karaf 3.0 release (lot of fixes, cleanups
and enhancements in progress).
 
We also included a new testing framework based on Pax Exam (part
of the Karaf tooling).
 
The resources for the sub-projects will be created soon (website, etc).
 
Web Site
========
We published a new web site to fix some typo mistakes and update the
online documentation.
The site will be updated soon to announce and give visibility
to the new sub-projects.

Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.
 
Community
=========
The community has changed a bit:
   * Christian Schneider has been voted in as a committer
 
We can note an increase of projects powered by Karaf.
Apache ServiceMix and Apache Geronimo already use Karaf.
We're discussing with Apache Directory about the usage of Karaf.
 
Development
===========
Four releases have been voted:
* Apache Karaf 2.1.6
* Apache Karaf 2.2.1
* Apache Karaf 2.2.2
* Apache Karaf 2.2.3
 
NB: we turned Apache Karaf 2.1.x branch in End Of Life mode. Apache Karaf 2.1.6 is the latest version on this branch.
 
We created the first Apache Karaf sub-project: Apache Karaf Cellar.
Apache Karaf Cellar is a cluster and cloud solution for Apache Karaf, powered by Hazelcast and jclouds.
We already released:
 * Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.1
 * Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.2
We started OBR broadcast and DOSGi implementation. It should be included in Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.3.
 
We can note that two Karaf sub-projects have been started in sandbox and promoted as Karaf sub-projects:
* Karaf WebConsole based on Pax-Wicket. This new console is very extend-able and highly pluggable. The purpose is to provide a complete enterprise administration and monitoring console, including a new look'n feel, and give a way for others projects (like ServiceMix, CXF or Camel for instance), to provide their own branding and modules.
  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/webconsole/
* Karaf Cave is an OBR server implementation, including storage, OBR metadata generation, Maven proxy support, REST API, etc. It will also aim to be a KFR (Karaf Feature Repository) and KAR (KAR Repository).
  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/cave/
 
We are also discussing with the author of EIK (Eclipse Integration for Karaf) to become a new Karaf sub-project (http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/eik/).
 
Web Site
=========
Web site has been updated to provide visibility to sub-projects such as Apache Karaf Cellar.
We also gave more visibility to the documentation, allowing to download the PDF format of our guides.
 
Branding
========
 * project website basics: ok
 * website nav links: ok
 * trademarks: ok
 * logo: we added the TM mention on the logo, and provide new "powered by Karaf" logo
 * metadata: ok

Community
=========
We've voted in 3 new committers:
 * Adrian Trenaman
 * Achim Nierbeck
 * ?ukasz Dywicki
One committer has been invited to the PMC:
 * Ioannis Cannellos

Development
===========
Two releases have been voted on:
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.1 on November 14th, 2010
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.2 on November 25th, 2010

We're working towards the 2.2.0 release, currently
targetted  for January. It has been delayed because
we're waiting for Aries to release a new version.

We've voted a new logo and are discussing a possible 
web site design change.  We're also planning to move
out of confluence for the website, possibly using
Scalate.

Branding
========
 * project website basics: home page is ok
 * website nav links: we're missing nearly all the links 
   but the one to the main ASF web site
 * trademarks: not really compliant here
 * logo: not really compliant yet
 * metadata: we have a registered doap file

h2. September 2010

{code}
Community
=========
We added the following committers:
 *  Hiram Chirino
 *  James Strachan
 *  Ioannis Canellos
James and Hiram were committers before we moved to TLP and asked 
to get their committership back, so they've been voted in back.  
Ioannis is a new Apache committer.
We also have other active contributors, so we expect some new
committers in the coming months.

Development
===========
No releases this month so far, but development continues towards 
our next point release of Karaf, with attention coming from users 
testing new features and suggesting improvements. We expect to 
release this new version before the end of the month.

h2. August 2010

{code}
Since the last July report, Apache Karaf 2.0.0 has been released.

Several patches have been supplied by contributors, but due to the 
holiday season, development has slowed down a bit during the past 
weeks.
{code}

h2. July 2010

{code}
It has been only a few weeks since the Karaf TLP has been established,
but the activity level is very high.   All resources have been set up
by infra (thx) and we have moved the opened JIRA issues and svn tree
from Felix to Karaf.

We've already received some patches from non developers, so I expect
the community to grow very soon.

We haven't released anything yet, and we're waiting for trunk to 
stabilize before releasing a 2.0 (new major version due to package
renaming).
{code}
