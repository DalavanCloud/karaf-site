h2. How do I edit the website?

h3. Organization

The web site consists of three main resources:
* the main web site available at [http://karaf.apache.org/]
* the manuals available at [http://karaf.apache.org/manual/]
* the wiki available at [http://cwiki.apache.org/KARAF/]

h3. Main site

The main website sources are located in svn at [{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/site/trunk}}].  This source tree is a maven project that uses [Scalate|http://scalate.fusesource.org] as a templating engine.
The easiest way to make some modifications to it is to run the following command:
{code}
mvn jetty:run -Plive
{code}
This will start up a jetty server and you'll be able to see the live rendering of the web site at
{code}
http://localhost:8080/
{code}

You can now make modifications to the source tree and reload the web page in your browser.  Changes will be picked up immediately.

The {{-Plive}} parameter allows updating without restarting the web server, but in some cases, there may be a few problems, so a final check can be done by running
{code}
mvn install
{code}

and checking the resulting site in {{target/sitegen}}.

If you don't have committer access, create a JIRA and attach the {{svn diff}} output to it so that we can apply it.
If you are a committer, just commit your changes.

To deploy your modifications, you need to run the following command:
{code}
mvn clean install scm-publish:publish-scm
{code}


h3. Manuals

After a release, the corresponding manual should be uploaded and the [documentation] updated.
Uploading the manual can be done by checking out the associated tag and running {{mvn scalate:deploy}} inside the {{manual}} module.

h3. Wiki

The wiki contains the 2.1.x manual and any collaboration documents, such as the roadmaps, etc...

You must have signed an ICLA to be able to edit the wiki pages
* Download and print the Apache Contributor License Agreement from [here|http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html]. You need to sign it, scan it and email it
* wait for your name to appear on the [list of received CLAs|http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html] see the _unlisted CLAs_ section.
* send an email to the [Karaf dev forum|Mailing Lists] about that your ICLA have been received at Apache.

To edit a page, just hit the *edit* link right at the bottom of any page. To be able to edit you need to register with confluence.

Note that after you've changed the wiki it is immediately rendered on the {{http://cwiki.apache.org/KARAF/}} site so you can test it out; then up to an hour or two later it is updated on the Apache site.
