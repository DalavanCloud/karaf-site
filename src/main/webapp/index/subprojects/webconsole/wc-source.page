h2. Web Browsing of Git

To browse via the Web, you can use the main Git site:

{panel}
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf-webconsole.git;a=summary
{panel}

h2. Cloning from Git

{code}
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf-webconsole.git cave
{code}

Only project developers can commit to the git repository.

h3. Branches

We use the master for the next main release; then we use a branch for any bug fixes on the previous major release. You can look at all branches here

{code}
git branch -a
{code}

And switch to a given branch:

{code}
git checkout branch_name
{code}

h2. Building the code

To then build the code see [Building|/index/subprojects/webconsole/building.html].
