h2. Release Notes - Karaf Cellar - Version 2.3.4

This release of Apache Karaf Cellar is the third one of the 2.3.x series branch.
It's fully compatible with Karaf 2.3.x version, and contains major bug fixes.

Cellar is a clustering solution for Apache Karaf powered by Hazelcast.

Cellar allows you to manage a cluster of Karaf instances, providing synchronisation between instances.

Here is a short list of provided features:
- Discovery: each Karaf Cellar node is discovered automatically by the others. You can use multicast or unicast for discovery.
- Cluster group: a Karaf Cellar node could be part of one or more cluster group. Each Karaf unit (features, config, etc) is targeted to a group.
- Distributed Configuration Admin: Karaf Cellar distributes the configuration data. The distribution is event-driven and filtered by cluster group.
- Distributed Features: Karaf Cellar distributes the features and repositories information. It's also event-driven. 
- Distributed Bundles: Karaf Cellar distributes the bundles, on an event-driven base.
- Local event distribution (optional): cellar-eventadmin feature provides broadcast of the local events to the cluster.
- Distributed OSGi (optional): cellar-dosgi provides support of Distributed OSGi, allowing to call an OSGi service present on a remote node.
- WebConsole (optional): cellar-webconsole provides Karaf WebConsole plugins, allowing you to monitore and administrate your cluster using your browser.

To install Cellar into your running Karaf instance, just install the Cellar feature:

{code}
karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.apache.karaf.cellar/apache-karaf-cellar/2.3.4/xml/features
karaf@root> features:install cellar
{code}
