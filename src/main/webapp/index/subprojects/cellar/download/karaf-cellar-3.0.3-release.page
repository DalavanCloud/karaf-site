h2. Release Notes - Karaf Cellar - Version 3.0.3

This release of Apache Karaf Cellar is the first one of the 3.0.x series.
It's fully compatible with Karaf 3.0.x version, and bug fixes, especially on the Synchronizers.

It provides a clustering solution for Apache Karaf powered by Hazelcast.

Cellar allows you to manage a cluster of several Karaf instances, provinding synchronization between instances.

Here is a short list of features:
    * Discovery: when you install Cellar into a Karaf instance, it automatically tries to discover other Cellar
      instances and join the cluster. There is no configuration required to join the cluster, the discovery is made
      behind the scene. You can use multicast or unicast for discovery.
    * Cluster group: a Karaf node could be part of one or more cluster group. In Cellar, you can define cluster group
      depending of your requirements. The resources will be sync between nodes of the same group.
    * Distributed Configuration Admin: Cellar distributes the configuration data. The distribution is event driven and
      filtered by group. You can tune the configuration replication using blacklist/whitelist on the configuration
      ID (PID).
    * Distributed Features Service: Cellar distributes the features/repositories info. It's also event-driven.
    * Provisioning: Cellar provides shell commands for basic provisioning. It can also use an OBR backend or another
      provisioning tool such as Apache ACE.

To install Cellar into your running Karaf instance, just install the Cellar feature:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.cellar/apache-karaf-cellar/3.0.3/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:install cellar
{code}

    * [KARAF-3715] - Cellar BundleMBean operations raise a NullPointerException
    * [KARAF-3716] - cluster:bundle-* commands don't correctly select bundles
    * [KARAF-3717] - Same bundle appears two times in cluster:bundle-list

h3. Dependency Upgrade
    * [KARAF-3708] - Upgrade to Hazelcast 3.4.2

h3. Improvement
    * [KARAF-3628] - Karaf Hazelcast instance should "merge" the members found by the discovery services
    * [KARAF-3664] - DOSGi exception handling and propagation
