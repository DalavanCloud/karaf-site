h2. Karaf Decanter

Decanter is a complete monitoring and alerting solution for Apache Karaf and related projects (like Camel, ActiveMQ, etc).

It's composed by:
- collectors retrieving monitored data (JMX metrics, log messages, ...)
- a dispatcher powered by EventAdmin
- appenders storing the monitored data (log, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, JDBC, ...)

h2. Quick Start

To install and start Decanter into your running Karaf instance, you have to install different Decanter features
depending the data that you want to collect, and the storage/appender that you want to use.

First you register the decanter features repository:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.decanter/apache-karaf-decanter/1.0.1/xml/features
{code}

To harvest JMX metrics:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-jmx
{code}

To harvest Camel metrics:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-camel
{code}

To harvest all Camel exchanges:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-camel-tracer
{code}

To harvest ActiveMQ metrics:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-activemq
{code}

To harvest Karaf log messages:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-log
{code}

To harvest data (like log messages) directly from files:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-file
{code}

To harvest some system commands output:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-system
{code}

To send the harvested/collected data into the log:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-appender-log
{code}

To store the harvested/collected data into elasticsearch:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install elasticsearch
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-appender-elasticsearch
{code}

To enable Kibana based dashboards on top of elasticsearch:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install kibana
{code}

To store the harvested/collected data into a JDBC backend:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-appender-jdbc
{code}

To send the harvested/collected data into a JMS queue or topic:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-appender-jms
{code}

To send the harvested/collected data into a Camel route:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-appender-camel
{code}

To enable SLA/alerting and send alerts in the log:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-sla-log
{code}

To enable SLA/alerting and send alerts by e-mail:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-sla-email
{code}

To enable SLA/alerting and send alerts to a Camel route:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-sla-camel
{code}
