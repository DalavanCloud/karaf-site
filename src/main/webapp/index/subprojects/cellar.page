h2. Karaf Cellar

Cellar is a clustering solution for Apache Karaf powered by Hazelcast.

Cellar allows you to manage a cluster of Karaf instances, providing synchronisation between instances.

Here is a short list of provided features:
- Discovery: each Karaf Cellar node is discovered automatically by the others. You can use multicast or unicast for discovery.
- Cluster group: a Karaf Cellar node could be part of one or more cluster group. Each Karaf unit (features, config, etc) is targeted to a group.
- Distributed Configuration Admin: Karaf Cellar distributes the configuration data. The distribution is event-driven and filtered by cluster group.
- Distributed Features Service: Karaf Cellar distributes the features and repositories information. It's also event-driven. 

h2. Quick Start

To install and start Cellar into your running Karaf instance, you have to install the Cellar feature:

{code}
karaf@root> feature:add-url mvn:org.apache.karaf.cellar/apache-karaf-cellar/2.3.0/xml/features
karaf@root> feature:install cellar
{code}

You're ready to use Cellar clustering. Take a look on the user guide.
