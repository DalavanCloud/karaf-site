h2. Karaf Cellar

Cellar is a clustering solution for Apache Karaf powered by Hazelcast.

Cellar allows you to manage a cluster of Karaf instances, providing synchronisation between instances.

Here is a short list of provided features:
- Discovery: each Karaf Cellar node is discovered automatically by the others. You can use multicast or unicast for discovery.
- Cluster group: a Karaf Cellar node could be part of one or more cluster group. Each Karaf unit (features, config, etc) is targeted to a group.
- Distributed Configuration Admin: Karaf Cellar distributes the configuration data. The distribution is event-driven and filtered by cluster group.
- Distributed Features: Karaf Cellar distributes the features and repositories information. It's also event-driven. 
- Distributed Bundles: Karaf Cellar distributes the bundles, on an event-driven base.
- Local event distribution (optional): cellar-eventadmin feature provides broadcast of the local events to the cluster.
- Distributed OSGi (optional): cellar-dosgi provides support of Distributed OSGi, allowing to call an OSGi service present on a remote node.
- WebConsole (optional): cellar-webconsole provides Karaf WebConsole plugins, allowing you to monitore and administrate your cluster using your browser.
