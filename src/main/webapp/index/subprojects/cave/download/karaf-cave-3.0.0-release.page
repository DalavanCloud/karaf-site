h2. Release Notes - Karaf Cave - Version 3.0.0

This release of Apache Karaf Cave is the first one of the 3.0.x series branch.
It's fully compatible with Karaf 3.0.x version, and contains major improvements and bug fixes.

Karaf Cave provides an OSGi Bundle Repository (OBR), simple Maven repository, and Karaf Features Repository (KFR).

OBR provides a service that can automatically install a bundle, with its deployment dependencies, from a bundle
repository.

Apache Karaf Cave provides the following features:

- Storage: Karaf Cave provides a filesystem storage. The storage backend is designed with a kind of plugin system, it means that we can change the default filesystem storage by another kind of storage
- OBR metadata generation: Karaf Cave automatically creates the OBR metadata for you, using the artifacts presents in the Cave repository.
- OBR registration: Karaf Cave allows you to directly register a Cave repository into the OBR RepositoryAdmin OSGi service.
- Artifact upload: you can update any OSGi bundle in a Cave repository, using advanced URL, e.g.  mvn:groupId/artifactId/version
- HTTP Maven/OBR: Karaf Cave provides a HTTP service where you can download artifacts and get OBR information.
- "External" repository proxy: you can proxy an existing repository (like a Maven one) into a Cave repository. In that case, the artifacts are still resident on the proxied repository, Cave handles the OBR metadata. Cave supports file: and http: like URL, it means that Cave is able to browse a remote HTTP Maven repository.
- "External" repository population: you can populate your local Cave repository from an external repository.  It means that Cave browse the external repository URL (file: or http:), looking for OSGi bundles in the artifacts, and copy the bundles in the Cave repository storage.

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.cave/apache-karaf-cave/3.0.0/xml/features
