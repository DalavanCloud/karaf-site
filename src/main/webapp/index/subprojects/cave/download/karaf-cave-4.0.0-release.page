h2. Release Notes - Karaf Cave - Version 4.0.0

This release of Apache Karaf Cave is the first one of the 4.0.x series branch.
It's fully compatible with Karaf 4.0.x version.

It's a complete new version of Cave, providing an implementation of OSGi Repository R5 specification. This
version is a complete refactoring of Cave.

Apache Karaf Cave is an Apache Karaf subproject. It provides an implementation of the OSGi Repository specification, with
additional feature such as a complete Maven repository support, a REST API for management, support of remote repository
proxy.

Cave deals with the requirements and capabilities of all artifacts.

Apache Karaf Cave provides the following features:
* Storage: Cave includes a storage backend. The default one is a simple filesystem backend. As the Cave backend
is designed in a plugin way, you can implement your own backend (for instance, JDBC or LDAP backend).
* Repository Metadata Generation: Cave creates the repository metadata for you, using the artifacts presents in the
repository storage.
* Maven support: Cave repositories act as a complete Maven repository, allowing you to use Cave directly with Maven.
* REST API: Cave provides a REST API to manipulate the repositories.
* Artifact Upload: Users can upload OSGi bundle in a Cave repository. It supports URLs like mvn:groupId/artifactId/version,
file:, http:, etc.
* Repository proxy: Cave is able to proxy an existing repository, for instance an existing Maven repository.
The artifacts are located on the "external" repository, Cave handles the repository metadata. Cave supports file: and http:
URLs, it means that Cave is able to browse a remote HTTP Maven repository for instance.
* Repository population: Cave is able to get artifacts present on an "external" repository (local file: or
remote http:), looking for OSGi bundles, and copy the artifacts in the Cave repository storage.

To install Cave into your running Karaf instance, just install the Cave Server feature:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.cave/apache-karaf-cave/4.0.0/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:install cave-server
{code}
