h2. Building 

Karaf EIK uses [Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] as its build tool.

h3. Prequisites

*Required:*
* Download and [install Maven 3.0.x|http://maven.apache.org/download.html]
* Get the latest [Source|/index/subprojects/eik/eik-source.html] 
* Java 1.6

h3. A normal build

{code}
mvn install
{code}

h3. Doing a Quick Build

The following avoids running all the unit test cases, we just skip the test running phase and not the building part
{code}
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
{code}

or

{code}
mvn -DskipTests clean install 
{code}

h3. Building source jars
If you want to build jar files with the source code, that for instance Eclipse can important so you can debug the Karaf code as well. Then you can run this command from the karaf root folder:
{code}
mvn clean source:jar install -Dtest=false
{code}
